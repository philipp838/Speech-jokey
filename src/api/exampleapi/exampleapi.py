"""
This is an example API implementation. It is a template for creating new APIs.

Each API consists of three classes:
- The API class itself, which is responsible for the API logic and the API calls.
- The API settings class, which is the 'middleware' between the global settings instance and the API widge (View).
- The API widget class, which is the 'View' of the API settings.

In general, there are multiple design patterns possible with this layout.

One possible design pattern is the following:
- Place all SETTING properties in the API widget class.
- Create a special object property (ObjectProperty) holding the instance of the API settings class inside the API widget class.
- BIND the SETTING properties with the widget properties of the API widget class.
- Create callbacks for UI changes, which will update the SETTING properties and then use the API settings object to update the global settings instance. (save_settings)
- The API settings class will load settings from the global settings instance and update the API widget properties. (load_settings)

Another possible design pattern is the following:
- Place all SETTING properties in the API settings class.
- Create a special object property (ObjectProperty) holding the instance of the API settings class inside the API widget class.
- BIND the SETTING properties with the widget properties of the API widget class.
- Create callbacks for UI changes, which will use the API settings object to update the SETTING properties and then instruct settings class to update the global settings instance (save_settings).
- The API settings class will load settings from the global settings instance and update its own SETTING properties. (load_settings)

Both of these design patterns are valid and it's up to the developer to decide which one to use.
Personally, I'd go with the second design pattern, since then it is easer to access settings from the API class. (Otherwise called middleware)

This layout originates from the fact that we're using the BaseApiSettings class to generalize the behaviour of interacting with the global settings instance.
Any derived class of BaseApiSettings will automatically have the required Singleton pattern implemented.

In general, it is NOT necessary to instantiate any of these classes, since the API factory will take care of that upon application startup.
